Residual analysis for noraxon IMU unit for yop chagi and ap chagi

Acceleration data from IMU Unit placed on an ankle of participant.

At first part I used only highpass frequencies. In the second I used 250 lowpass as recommended and I tried different high pass from 0.1 to 27 Hz.

Graphs looks odd, maybe because filtered data are much different from raw data.

In excel columns corresponds to XYZ axis. For example 01 x means 0.1 X axis data, 03x 0.3x frequency for high pass, 15x for 15 X highpass etc.
